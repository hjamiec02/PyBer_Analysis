# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to create a summary of Pyber's ride sharing data by city type. The data consisted of three city types, Rural, Urban and Suburban. For this challenge I used Pandas and Matplotlib to create a data frame that showed the city types by total number of rides, total number of drivers, sum of the fares, average fare per ride for each city type and average fare per driver for each city type.

## Results
The Pyber data frame showed an increase in total number of rides and drivers as the city population increased, as would be expected due to an increase in need for rides in a more populated area. Alternatively the as the population density decreased the average fare per ride and average fare per driver increased. This increase also makes sense due to supply and demand. As the population decreases there are fewer drivers available meaning the fare would be higher. A screenshot of the data frame is posted below.

A multi-line chart was created to compare the three city types over the course of four month. The line chart showed total weekly fares for each city type from January 2019 through April 2019. Each city type followed a similar trend as rides increased in late February before gradually tapering back to normal to lower levels over the month of March, before picking up again in April. A screenshot of the line chart is posted below.

## Summary
After performing the analysis on the Pyber ride sharing data, a few assumptions can be drawn. First, since the number of drivers and rides increase in more populated areas but fares increase in less populated areas, the company could consider limiting the number of drivers available in the urban areas at specific times in an attempt to increase the fare per ride. Additionally, the company could take a closer look at trying to recruit more divers in rural areas to keep fare cost more reasonable.  Lastly, based off of the data from the line chart, the company should take closer look at what other factors are contributing to the fluctuations in rides and average fares over the course of the sample months.
